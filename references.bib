	abstract = {A general framework for handling a wide variety of scheduling problems arising in multiproduct/multipurpose batch chemical plants is presented.  This new approach has the flexibility to accommodate various process characteristics. Furthermore, it is able to deal in a natural manner with a number of objectives and constraints imposed on the plant.  Batch plant involving a variety of complexities is represented using a State Task Network. The novel feature of this representation is that both the individual batch operations (“tasks”) and the feedstocks, intermediate and final products (“states”) are included explicitly as network nodes.  The mathematical formulation of the problem has resulted in a mixed integer linear programming model. A special schedule generating algorithm has been developed, using the branch and bound technique to obtain the optimal solution. The amount of search required by the algorithm has been substantially reduced by introducing branch cutting rules devised from physical considerations of the process, without compromising the optimality of the solution obtained.},
