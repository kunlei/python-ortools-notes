    "Integer programming has a wide range of applications across various industries and domains. Some of the classical applications of integer programming include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Production Planning and Scheduling: Integer programming is widely used in production planning and scheduling to optimize the allocation of resources, such as machines, workers, and raw materials. It helps to minimize costs and maximize efficiency by determining the optimal production schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Network Optimization: Integer programming is used in network optimization problems such as routing, scheduling, and allocation of resources in transportation networks, telecommunication networks, and supply chain management.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Facility Location: Integer programming is used in facility location problems, which involve determining the optimal location for a facility based on various factors such as demand, supply, and transportation costs. It is commonly used in logistics, transportation, and distribution industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Portfolio Optimization: Integer programming is used in finance to optimize investment portfolios, where the goal is to maximize the returns on the investment while minimizing risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cutting Stock and Bin Packing: Integer programming is used in cutting stock and bin packing problems where items of varying sizes must be packed into containers or cut from a stock. This is commonly used in the packaging and manufacturing industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Crew Scheduling: Integer programming is used in crew scheduling problems, where the goal is to optimize the allocation of crew members to different shifts, duties, or activities. It is commonly used in industries such as airlines, railways, and public transportation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Timetabling: Integer programming is used in timetabling problems such as scheduling classes, exams, and events in academic institutions. It helps to minimize scheduling conflicts and maximize resource utilization."
