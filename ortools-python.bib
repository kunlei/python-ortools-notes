	abstract = {This is a proposal for the application of discrete linear programming to the typical job-shop scheduling problem—one that involves both sequencing restrictions and also noninterference constraints for individual pieces of equipment. Thus far, no attempt has been made to establish the computational feasibility of the approach in the case of large-scale realistic problems. This formulation seems, however, to involve considerably fewer variables than two other recent proposals [Bowman, E. H. 1959. The schedule-sequencing problem. Opns Res. 7 621–624; Wagner, H. 1959. An integer linear-programming model for machine scheduling. Naval Res. Log. Quart. (June).], and on these grounds may be worth some computer experimentation.},

	abstract = {A general framework for handling a wide variety of scheduling problems arising in multiproduct/multipurpose batch chemical plants is presented.  This new approach has the flexibility to accommodate various process characteristics. Furthermore, it is able to deal in a natural manner with a number of objectives and constraints imposed on the plant.  Batch plant involving a variety of complexities is represented using a State Task Network. The novel feature of this representation is that both the individual batch operations (“tasks”) and the feedstocks, intermediate and final products (“states”) are included explicitly as network nodes.  The mathematical formulation of the problem has resulted in a mixed integer linear programming model. A special schedule generating algorithm has been developed, using the branch and bound technique to obtain the optimal solution. The amount of search required by the algorithm has been substantially reduced by introducing branch cutting rules devised from physical considerations of the process, without compromising the optimality of the solution obtained.},
