    "The bin packing problem (BPP) is a classic optimization problem in computer science that involves packing a set of items into a minimum number of bins or containers, subject to certain constraints. The problem is also known as the container loading problem, or the bin packing optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the bin packing problem, we are given a set of items, each with a weight or size, and a set of bins, each with a fixed capacity. The goal is to pack the items into the bins such that the number of bins used is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is NP-hard, which means that there is no known algorithm that can solve it in polynomial time. However, several heuristic algorithms have been developed that can provide good solutions in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bin packing problem has many real-world applications, such as optimizing the use of storage space in warehouses, minimizing the number of trucks needed for transportation, and optimizing the use of computer memory. It is also a fundamental problem in the study of computational complexity theory and has been extensively studied in the fields of operations research, computer science, and mathematics."

    "To formally express the bin packing problem (BPP), we use the notation of a set of items that need to be packed into a set of bins. The set of items is denoted as $\\mathcal{I}$, while the set of bins is denoted as $\\mathcal{J}$. Each item $i$ in $\\mathcal{I}$ has a size denoted as $s_i$, and each bin $j$ in $\\mathcal{J}$ has a fixed capacity denoted as $Q$. \n",

The second constraint (\\ref{bin-cons2}) ensures that each item is placed in exactly one bin. The third constraint (\\ref{bin-cons3}) restricts the binary variable $y_j$ to only take the values 0 or 1. This constraint ensures that only the used bins are counted in the objective function.
