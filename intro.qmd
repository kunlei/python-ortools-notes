# Introduction {#sec-intro}

This book covers the usage of Google OR-Tools to solve optimization problems in Python.
There are several major chapters in this book:

In [Chapter -@sec-setup], we explain the steps needed to setup OR-Tools in a Python environment.

In [Chapter -@sec-linear], we use an example to illustrate the modeling capability of OR-Tools to solve linear programming problems.

In [Chapter -@sec-integer], we go through the modeling techniques made available in OR-Tools.
